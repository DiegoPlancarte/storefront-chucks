# storefront-chucks
Demo store built on top of Moqui PopRestStore

This component is configured to render at the address chucks.test/store, where chucks.test should be defined as an alias for localhost in your system's hosts file. This allows both the PopRestStore demo store and the chucks store to render. Alternatively you could update the store setting to use the 'localhost' hostname for this component and render it at localhost:8080/store.
